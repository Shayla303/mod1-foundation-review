## Mod 1 Break Week Review Work

1. array prototype review
2. TDD a mythical-creature style exercise
3. ice cream cone generator DOM manipulation

## Setup

1. Clone down this repository  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Run the provided test file (if you need to) by running the command indicated in that section.
4. Note: The ice cream generator exercise does not have a test suite

### Exercise 1: array-prototypes

A series of exercises designed to work on muscle memory with the Array Prototype Methods:
* `forEach()`  
* `sort()`  
* `map()`  
* `filter()`  

The repo has a set of tests you need to make pass using the indicated prototype method. To run the tests, make sure you are starting from the parent directory and run the following command:

```
npm test array-prototypes/array-test.js
```

### Exercise 2: mini-adventures of blocky

This section contains a series of tests that you must make pass by implementing the functionality indicated by each test.

Similar to mythical creatures, these tests ask you to build out a `Block` and a `World` (think about watching a square move around in a square box on the DOM - HEY! Sounds like Game Time prep...)    

You'll need to flesh out both the `blocky.js` file as well as a `world.js` file and make all tests pass.

```
npm test blocky/blocky-test.js
```

### Exercise 3: Ice Cream Cone Generator

You will do a DOM manipulation exercise. Instructions and expectations are listed in the `ice-cream-cone-generator.md` file.
